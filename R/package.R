#' 'WebDriver' Client for 'PhantomJS'
#'
#' A client for the 'WebDriver' 'API'. It allows driving a (probably
#' headless) web browser, and can be used to test web applications,
#' including 'Shiny' apps. In theory it works with any 'WebDriver'
#' implementation, but it was only tested with 'PhantomJS'.
